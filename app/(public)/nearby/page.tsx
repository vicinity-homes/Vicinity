/**
 * `/nearby` → 308 redirect to `/browse?tab=nearby`.
 *
 * Phase 37 (2026-06-18): the standalone /nearby grid was folded into the
 * Explore page as a sub-tab (Douyin 推荐/同城 model). The route is kept as
 * a permanent redirect so external links, profile shortcuts, and the
 * `vicinity:nearby_radius` localStorage flow (handed off to <NearbyClient>
 * unchanged inside /browse) keep working.
 *
 * The `NearbyClient` component itself still lives at
 * `app/(public)/nearby/NearbyClient.tsx` — `/browse/page.tsx` imports it.
