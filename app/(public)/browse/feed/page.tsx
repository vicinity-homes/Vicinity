 * to deep-link the swipe view to a specific listing. Without `start`, the
 * feed renders top-down (back-compat for any external links pointing at
 * the previous `/browse` URL).
 *
 * Phase 27.4 (2026-06-16): also accepts `?community=<slug>` to scope
 * the feed to active listings inside a single community. Linked from
 * `/c/[slug]` tiles. Unknown slug falls through to global feed silently.
