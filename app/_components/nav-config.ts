 * Phase 26 (2026-06-14): introduced when porting mobile-only chrome to desktop.
 * Phase 27 (2026-06-16): drop "Home" tab, promote "Community" to leftmost slot
 * for both buyer and agent. Buyer middle slot is now the emphasized "Explore"
 * FAB-style entry into the swipe feed (consumption, not navigation). Agent
 * left cluster is [Dashboard, Community]; right cluster unchanged.
