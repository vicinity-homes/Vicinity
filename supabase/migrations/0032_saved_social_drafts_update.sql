-- ─── 0032_saved_social_drafts_update ──────────────────────────────
-- Phase 48.4 (2026-06-22). Allow agents to edit their own saved drafts
-- in place. Phase 48.2 made drafts immutable to keep the surface simple,
-- but qiaoxux wants in-place edit so a refined post can be saved without
-- the delete + re-save dance (which also loses the original timestamp).
--
-- Why now: edits feed back into regenerate. If a user tweaks a draft,
-- the next "Regenerate" should treat that edited body as the seed. Edit
-- + persist is the natural shape.
--
-- Constraints:
--   * Only body / language are user-editable. platform stays pinned to
--     the original — switching platforms means a different draft.
--   * created_at stays put; we add updated_at to surface "last edited".
--   * RLS update policy mirrors select: agent → own drafts only.
