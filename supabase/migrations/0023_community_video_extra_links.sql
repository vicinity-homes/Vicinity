-- 0023: community video N:N extra links
--
-- Phase 27 (2026-06-16): Each community_video already has a single primary
-- community_id (the one the uploading agent picks at upload time). To support
-- "this video also makes sense in these other communities" without forcing
-- agents to re-upload, we add a side table that records additional memberships.
-- The original community_videos.community_id stays put — it's still the
-- "origin / primary" community and continues to drive existing queries.
--
-- The unified membership view (community_video_membership) collapses primary +
-- extras so /c/[slug] pages can do one read.

create table public.community_video_extra_links (
  community_id uuid not null references public.communities on delete cascade,
  video_id     uuid not null references public.community_videos on delete cascade,
  created_at   timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (community_id, video_id)
);

-- Public can read all extra links (mirrors the public-readable policy on
-- community_videos itself).
create policy "public reads community video extra links"
  on public.community_video_extra_links
  for select using (true);

-- Authenticated agents manage links (write-side authorization further
-- enforced by server actions checking that the agent owns the underlying
-- video). RLS-only check keeps this DB-level guardrail at "must be logged
-- in", same shape as the community_videos write policy.
create policy "agents manage community video extra links"
  on public.community_video_extra_links
  for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Membership view: unifies primary + extras. UNION (not UNION ALL) so that
-- a video accidentally linked back to its own primary community does not
-- duplicate. Read-side queries use this view; writes still target the
-- underlying tables directly.
