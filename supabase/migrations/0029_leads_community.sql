-- ─── 0029_leads_community ───────────────────────────────────────────
-- Phase 45.18 (2026-06-20).
--
-- Extend `leads` to accept community-targeted contacts. Owner rule:
-- "if exploring community directly, contact community owner". The
-- direct `/c/[slug]/feed` Contact button needs a place to land its
-- row when the buyer is interested in the neighborhood at large
-- (no listing context). agent_id is still required (NOT NULL), but
-- now derived from `communities.created_by` instead of `listing.agent_id`.
--
-- Additive: existing listing-leads keep working unchanged.

-- Exactly one of listing_id / community_id must be set (a lead is
-- about a specific home OR a specific community, never both, never
-- neither).
