## Conventions

- Branch: `main` is production. Feature branches `feat/<short-name>`.
- Commit style: imperative mood, prefix with phase/module: `phase2: add tus uploader`.
- One in-progress PR at a time. Each PR maps to one task in IMPLEMENTATION.md.
- All API boundaries validate input with zod. TypeScript types are not runtime checks.

## Production health check

After every phase merges to `main`, run the smoke test against production:

```bash
bash scripts/admin/production-smoke.sh
# or against a custom host:
BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com bash scripts/admin/production-smoke.sh
```

Curls 5 unauthenticated routes (landing, login, dashboard gate, auth-callback no-code,
public-listing 404 shape). Exits non-zero on any failure. Cookie-bound flows
(magic-link, dashboard SSR, upload, lead form) need a real browser — out of scope here.

## Positioning (do not drift)

Vicinity is for **all US homebuyers**. NOT a Chinese-community platform. No `_zh` fields,
no WeChat fields, no bilingual UI. English only for V1.
See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full positioning statement.
